    <td>Used this for online compiling. It's a free compiler that allows the addition of csv and wikitext files for testing. Since InfinityFree would not allow me to upload test files sometimes, I used this compiler to save time of waiting for the slow hosting platform. This online compiler was easy to use. The code I tested on here, I simply copied and pasted to Visual Studio Code to push to GitHub and InfinityFree once the test files were able to upload.</td>

    <td>I've used this resource to learn many other programming languages. This resource is more helpful than any textbook I have ever read in my life. This was very helpful in understanding PHP. Since I already learned HTML and CSS through this in the past, I only used this to learn PHP. I would easily recommend this resource to anyone learning to program in a new language. Due to having to learn PHP in a short period of time, I knew this resource the best and utilized it for a faster learning experience.</td>

    <td>The test files that would be used to test the code were on here. So, I copied and pasted the csv data into my own test files to test it with my code. Additionally, the starter codes were here. I first downloaded this code at the beginning of this project to help me get started. The starter code on here helped me create the table for the CSV parser.</td>

    <td>Regex expressions, in my opinion, are the most annoying to use. I get tired of them really fast. This resource made the regex process more bearable, since testing regex expressions was really easy on this site. Simply pasting or writing a regex expressions and pasting the test cases would show if it worked or not. It would also show up till which point it did not work or worked. This made the regex expression easier to tweek for minor changes or modifications.</td>

    <td>Had to use some source to host my website. This was the one that was mentioned during class alongside Docker. I don't like Docker, so I used this hosting platform. I had a terrible experience, but still seemed better than Docker. The files would always not upload, and allow me to upload at random times. So, for testing, it took me more time due to the platform's errors of file uploads. I don't plan on going into Web Development, so hopefully I will never have to use this platform ever again.</td>

Additionally, this resource consisted of answered questions from fellow classmates and had quick responses to doubts. This was primary reference throughout the process to get any updates on the project and clarifications.</td>
