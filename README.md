# CSCE315-PHP-Based-Website

### Instructions

The main file that serves as the entry to your web site will be "index.php". A PHP file mixes HTML, CSS, javascript, to generate static/dynamic content. For example, this course's web page is written in PHP. The PHP script can be written in any style, and the content can be of your choosing, but it will require the following technical elements:

  A multiple-page web site focused on highlighting your professional skills.
  
  * index.php : main page -- your basic professional information, education, skills, experiences, professional interests.
  * gallery.php : gallery (Javascript-based): highlight your previous project screenshots or other people's project you find interesting.
  * blog.php : development blog (Writing requirement)
  * tips.php : coding tips collection
  * resources.php : resources collection
  
Use of CSS for consistent styling across the entire site: headings, paragraphs, code boxes, etc.

Use of the following elements in your PHP scripts:
   * regular expressions
   * file I/O
   * arrays
   * sorting
   * date/time functions
   * automatically generated tabular data
   * HTML forms (implementing search function)
   * security features (sanitizing user input)
   * Javascript functions for image gallery UI and navigation
  
There are four major features you need to support:
   * CSV file processor : to display tabular data read from a file.
   * Simplified Wikitext processor : to display Wikitext-like formatted text, read from a file.
   * Interactive gallery : photo gallery supporting navigation and different views (list view vs. matrix view), and thumbnail size control.
   * Search : search for text in your web site.
